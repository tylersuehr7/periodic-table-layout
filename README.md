# Periodic Table Layout

This library provides two awesome ViewGroups:
* TableLayout
* PeriodicTableLayout

#### TableLayout
Essentially the TableLayout is a super simplified and way more efficient version of
Android's TableLayout widget.

#### PeriodicTableLayout
The PeriodicTableLayout takes it a step further by explicitly defining the rows (9) and
columns (18) and adding margin at the 8th row to provide the look of the Periodic Table
of Elements.
